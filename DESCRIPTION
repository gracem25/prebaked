Description: This package was designed as part of Assignment B2 for STAT 545B. Given a data frame `data` and a column `group`, `count_all_missing_by_group()` creates a new data frame with one row per level of `group`. The first column of the output data frame contains the levels of `group`, and the rest of the columns contain the number of missing values for all columns in `data` except `group`.
