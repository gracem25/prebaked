Description: This package was designed as part of Assignment B2 for STAT 545B. It is 
designed to be a wrapper around the `group_by()` and `summarize()` functions in the 
`dplyr` package. Given a data frame `data` and a column `group`, 
`count_all_missing_by_group()` creates a new data frame with one row per level of 
`group`. The first column of the output data frame contains the levels of `group`, 
and the rest of the columns contain the number of missing values for all columns in 
`data` except `group`.
